## Generate Table 1

### LA
* Input data: folder 'raters' which contains info of the 120 raters that took the assesment, dataset folder containing the well formatted .xls dataset, mae and rmse results for each raters for the 8 baselines, iQoE, p1203, LSTM and personalized baselines as .npy files
* Run generate_Table_1.py to print the values of TAble 1 and run all the other scripts contained in scripts. Those files produce in output folder:
  * the gain factors of iQoE respect to the 8 baselines trained with MOS plus LSTM and P1203 models as .xlsx files
  * the gain factors of iQoE respect to the 8 baselines trained with individual raters scores plus LSTM and P1203 models as .xlsx files

### LB
* Input data: folder 'raters' which contains info of the 120 raters that took the assesment, dataset folder containing the well formatted .xls dataset, mae and rmse results for each raters for the 8 baselines, iQoE, p1203, LSTM and personalized baselines as .npy files
* Run generate_Table_1.py to print the values of Table 1 and run all the other scripts contained in scripts. Those files produce in output folder:
  * the gain factors of iQoE respect to the 8 baselines trained with MOS plus LSTM and P1203 models as .xlsx files
  * the gain factors of iQoE respect to the 8 baselines trained with individual raters scores plus LSTM and P1203 models as .xlsx files
