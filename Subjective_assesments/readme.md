## Subjective assessments:
* Generation of videos:
  * in video_generations folder follow the readme.md file in Video_preparation to generate video chunks for the different rugs of the encoding ladder.
  * in video_generations folder follow the readme.md file in Experience_pool_generation to generate the video pool of impaired videos.
* Web site creation:
  * in iQoE_web folder follow the readme.md file in to create the web site for running iQoE in real scenario.
  * in the real website implementation we implemented a mechanism that return a unique code to be used by Microworkers workers to verify that they completed the assessment. This mechanism is not present in this implementation.

You need to have FFmpeg installed in your computer to generate the videos.
