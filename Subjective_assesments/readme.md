## Subjective assessments:
* In folder video_generation is possible to generate videos:
  1. Video_preparation: follow the readme.md file to generate video chunks for the different rungs of the encoding ladder.
  2. Experience_pool_generation: follow the readme.md file to generate the experience set.
* In iQoE_web there is the code for developing the web site for subjective assessments, more detail in the readme.md file

#### info
1. You need to have FFmpeg installed in your computer to generate the videos.
2. In the real website implementation we implemented a mechanism that return a unique code to be used by Microworkers workers to verify that they completed the assessment. This mechanism is not present in this implementation.
