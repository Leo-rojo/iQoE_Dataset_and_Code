  <h1>Training of Your Personalized QoE Model</h1>
    <p align="justify" style="width:800px">To construct a personalized Quality of Experience (QoE) model for your individual perception of video quality, this website will present 120 video clips and ask you to score them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="width:800px">If you use the site for the first time, press the "Start a New Session" button.</li>
      <li style="width:800px">If you want to continue with an earlier unfinished session, press the "Resume an Earlier Session" button.</li>
    </ul>
 <p>Please be aware that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li style="width:800px"> The long duration and repetitive pattern of watching the video clips and providing QoE scores might cause psychological stress and tiredness.
    <li style="width:800px"> The video clips, extracted from the short film "Tears of Steel", might contain sensitive content.
    <li style="width:800px"> In order to resume a paused session, we use cookies that contain no personal information and expire after 3 days.
    </ul>
  <p> By clicking "Accept and Start a New Session" or "Accept and Resume an Earlier Session", you are confirming that <b>you have read and agree to terms and conditions of this assessment.</b>  </p>
