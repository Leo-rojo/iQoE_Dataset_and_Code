## Generate p1203 and LSTM scores predictions for synthetic users:
* input files: "feat_iQoE_for_synth_exp.npy", "chunk_features_not_qp" folder containing description of various encoded chunks wihtout qp values, "encoded_video_chunked" which contains the actual encoded chunks (LSTM model needs the QP values of the actual videos). For memory reason copy of this folder can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a_Nz6TdHVVWmrDaRsZ1nFicArBTH4ETZ/view?usp=sharing
and "ffmpeg-debug-qp" which contains the ffmpeg software for caclulate qp values of videos. For memory reason copy of this folder can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OP9h7jQ7BSU50qT6ox4Hsz4VIYrriDAW/view?usp=share_link
* Run "p1203_scores.py" to generate the scores given by p1203 linearly scaled between 1-100 for all the 1000 experiences, the results will be saved in file "p1203_scores.npy" which is used for figure 16.
* Run "LSTM_scores.py" to generate the scores given by LSTM model for all the 1000 experiences, the results will be saved in file "scoresbiqps.npy" which is used for figure 16. In order to run it you need to install the LSTM model, link: https://github.com/acmmmsys/2020-BiQPS
