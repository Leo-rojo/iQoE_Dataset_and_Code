## Generate Figure 17:

### LA
* Input data: folders SVRigs_results_qn_99_nr_ch_7_perc that contains data for different ratio of train and test splits
* Run generate_figure_17.py to generate figure 17
* Run Plot_legend to generate the legend for figure 17

### LB
* Input data: folder features_generated_experiences, synthetic_users_scores_for_generated_experiences, generated in Synthetic_users_implementation
* Run generate_figure_17.py to generate figure 17 and run all the other scripts contained in scripts. Those files produce in output folder:
  * folders SVRigs_results_qn_99_nr_ch_7_perc that contains data for different ratio of train and test splits
* Run Plot_legend to generate the legend for figure 17
* N.B. The scripts use parallelization which can consume a lot of memory. In order to run the scripts some hours are needed.
