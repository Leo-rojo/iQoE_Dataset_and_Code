## Generate Figure 11:

### LA
* Input data: modeler_results_qn_250_nr_ch_7_1rigs folders for different machine learning algorithms and RIGS as sampler
* Run generate_figure_11.py to generate figure 11
* Run Plot_legend to generate the legend for figure 11

### LB
* Input data: folder features_generated_experiences and synthetic_raters_scores_for_generated_experiences. Both of them can be generated in Synthetic_raters_implementation.
* Run generate_figure_11.py to generate figure 11 and run all the other scripts contained in scripts. Those files produce in output folder:
  * modeler_results_qn_250_nr_ch_7_1rigs folders for different machine learning algorithms and RIGS as sampler
* Run Plot_legend to generate the legend for figure 10
* N.B. The scripts use parallelization which can consume a lot of memory. In order to run the scripts some hours are needed.
