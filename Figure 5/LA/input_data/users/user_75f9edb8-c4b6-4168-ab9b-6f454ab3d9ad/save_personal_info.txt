suggestions_I feel like there were a lot of videos with the same issues, so some could be removed in order not to do all 120.

Some of the videos also have quite a bit of motion that my screen can capture so-so... Not sure if intended, but probably my scores were biased because of that.

Also, for the valuation part of this assessment, I believe there are more feelings between pleasant and slightly annoying... :)
